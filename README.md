🧠 LogMaster
Your Smart, Automated Log Organizer
🌟 Introduction

In today’s fast-paced software world, logs are the heartbeat of every system — but they often end up as chaotic, scattered files buried in folders nobody opens.
That’s where LogMaster comes in — a lightweight, intelligent log organizer built to bring structure, clarity, and automation to system log management.

Whether you’re a developer debugging an issue, a system admin tracking server health, or a security analyst monitoring events — LogMaster helps you find the right logs at the right time.

🧩 What is LogMaster?

LogMaster is a command-line and containerized tool (Docker-ready) written in Go that automatically:

Scans a directory full of messy log files

Classifies them by type, date, and source

Organizes them into a clean, meaningful folder structure

It’s like having a digital assistant who tidies up your entire /logs directory for you.

🧙‍♀️ Why I Built It — The Story Behind LogMaster

As a developer, I often found myself lost in a sea of random .log files —
app.log, error_22_10.log, temp-2.log, server-2-final.log... you name it.

Every time I needed to debug or audit something, I’d spend more time searching than fixing.
So I decided to automate the mess.

That’s how LogMaster was born — out of frustration, curiosity, and the desire to build something that makes everyday developer life simpler.
